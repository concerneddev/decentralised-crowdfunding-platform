# Decentralized Crowdfunding Platform

A platform for creating and funding campaigns using a hybrid architecture combining blockchain and centralized technologies.

## Key Features
* User registration and authentication
* Campaign creation and management
* Decentralized funding via Ethereum (Sepolia Testnet)
* Centralized metadata storage and retrieval

## Technology Stack
* **Smart Contracts:** Solidity, Foundry, Openzeppelin
* **Blockchain:** Sepolia Testnet, Ethers.js
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, JSON Web Tokens
* **Frontend:** React

## How it Works
Users register and can either create or support campaigns. Campaigns are managed on the blockchain (Sepolia Testnet) using smart contracts for fund distribution and transparency. Campaign metadata is stored in a centralized database for efficient retrieval.

**Note:** This project is currently under development and uses the Sepolia Testnet for testing purposes.
